## How it works
The GitLab Connector picks up all of the Merge Requests and Issues in a specified repository.
- It will index both Open and Closed MRs. This includes the Title and Summary.
- It will index Issues and comments both Open and Closed
- Includes certain other metadata such as the URL, creator, etc.

## Setting up
### Authorization

    3. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
    4. Select Edit **profile**.
    5. Select **Add new token**.


    6. Enter a name and expiry date for the token.
        - The token expires on that date at midnight UTC.
        - If you do not enter an expiry date, the expiry date is automatically set to 365 days later than the current date.
        - By default, this date can be a maximum of 365 days later than the current date.
